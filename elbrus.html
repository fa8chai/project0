            <h1>Mount Elbrus</h1>
            <h3>Mount Elbrus is the highest mountain in Europe and the tenth most prominent peak in the world.

              It is located in the Caucasus Mountains in Southern Russia, near the border with Georgia.
              
              Mount Elbrus is a dormant volcano and was formed more than 2.5 million years ago.</h3>

                <h2>First ascent</h2>
                <p>The lower of the two summits was first ascended on 22 July [O.S. 10 July] 1829 by Khillar Khachirov, a guide for an Imperial Russian army scientific expedition led by General Emmanuel, and the higher (by about 40 m; 130 ft) in 1874 by an English expedition led by F. Crauford Grove and including Frederick Gardner, Horace Walker, and the Swiss guide Peter Knubel of St. Niklaus in the canton Valais.</p>

                  <h2>Name</h2>
                  <p>The name of Mount Elbrus is derived from Alborz, which in turn comes from Harā Bərəzaitī, a mountain in Persian mythology. This translates to "High Sentinel." Elbrus also has other names in other languages including Mingi Tau which translates to “Eternal Mountain” or “Like a Thousand Mountains” in Turkic; Yalbuz or “Ice Mane” in Turkic; and Oshkhamakhua or “Mountain of Happiness” in Circassian.</p>

                    <h2>Climate</h2>
                    <p>The climate is most conducive to climbing in July and August, when the weather is at its most stable.

                        Even in the summer, nighttime temperatures average 18 F (minus 8 C). Temperatures above the snowline can fall as low as minus 22 F (minus 30 C) during the day during the winter.
                        
                        Winter is coldest in the western part. It lasts from October to April above 6,562 feet (2,000 m).
                        
                        While the mountain is inland, it is positioned between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. These two large bodies of water have an impact on wind and precipitation.</p>
